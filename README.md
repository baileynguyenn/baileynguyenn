# Hello! I'm Bailey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Data Analyst passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. Currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at La Trobe University, I specialize in predictive modeling, data cleaning, and visualization using tools like R, Python, SQL, and Power BI. Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from market research to real estate analytics, always aiming to uncover meaningful trends and insights.

For my projects, I upload to GitHub regularly once I've made significant progress. Feel free to explore my repositories, fork, or create a pull request to contribute!
